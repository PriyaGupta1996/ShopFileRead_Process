# ShopFileRead_Process
This is for reading the huge data from text file and processing it according to the questions. 
## Write a program that reads this data and reports:
1.	Total sales of the store.
2.	Month wise sales totals.
3.	Most popular item (most quantity sold) in each month.
4.	Items generating most revenue in each month.
5.	For the most popular item, find the min, max and average number of orders each month.
Do not load this data into an SQL table or use libraries like Pandas. Get these results using basic data structures like list and maps.
